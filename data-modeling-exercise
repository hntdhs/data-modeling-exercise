Outer space: eliminate duplication with a separate table for the orbits_around column, and represent them in the outer_space table as foreign keys. Create a separate table for moons, that would use the id number for planets from this outer_space table in a column to show which planet each orbit. Could use the id numbers for the moons in that table to plug into the moon column in this one?

Air traffic: if the same table repeating dozens of times is intentional (and I don’t see what in the code is making that happen) obviously that would be eliminated. There’s not a lot of duplication with city names, though if the table were much bigger there likely would be and it might be smart to make a table with departure and destination locations and use the ID numbers from that in this main table. You could do the same with the airline names. 

Music: is it necessary to have artist and producer names as dictionaries? I assume it’s because some of the songs have multiple listings in those columns, but it doesn’t look ideal.
